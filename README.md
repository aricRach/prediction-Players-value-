# Our Goal

In this project we tried to predict the current value of football players in the Premier League in accordance with the statistics of their performance last season.

The aim of the project was to create a machine learning model that would predict the market value of defensive players in the English Premier League.


# Data Collection

To this end, we collected data on 103 defensive players who played in the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season. For each player, we collected statistics of 24 categories that characterize the the defensive players, and form the basis for determining the market value of each player.

In addition to all of these categories, we examined for each player his current market value. This is the same variable that the model we built tries to estimate, based on the data we collected on the players
